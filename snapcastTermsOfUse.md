    - SnapCast Free Service: a free service which provides use of a feature to store job information (such as your personal information, measurements, photos, social media accounts, etc.) designed for easy recall. This service allows you to submit your details to an unlimited number of agencies and scouts who are in the SnapCast network of users. Once you submit to your first agent, a 30-day (thirty day) period commences. During this time agents are able to express interest in you and communicate with you about further prospects. Your profile information is visible only to those agents to whom you submit within the 30-day period once that period has commenced (i.e. beginning with your first submission). At the expiry of the 30-day period, your profile then goes into a SnapCast general population (&quot;GenPoP) folder where it remains—free if charge— for an additional 30-day period of time, during which it is visible to all agents and scouts in the SnapCast network of users. This is designed to allow agencies and scouts to whom you did submit (and those to whom you did not submit) to view your profile information and reach out to you. You will also continue to receive offers and promotions from SnapCast&#39;s third party partners during this time. At the expiry of the 30-day free access in the &quot;GenPop&quot; folder, SnapCast will notify you that your account is to be deleted unless you chose to continue to remain a SnapCast member by subscribing to our Premium Service.
    - SnapCast Premium Service: a subscription fee-based service which provides unlimited access to the SnapCast &quot;GenPop&quot; folder, permitting all agencies and scouts in the SnapCast member network to continue to have access to your profile, send you notifications and communicate with you at their sole discretion when and if they so choose. You also have an opportunity to update your profile, personal information, photos, etc., so long as your maintain your SnapCast Premium Service subscription. As a subscriber to SnapCast&#39;s Premium Service you will also continue to receive notifications and promotions related to the modeling industry from our third party partners.

1. **Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**
    1. **Governing Law.** You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in New York; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort _or statute_) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, _and enforced in accordance with_, the internal laws of the State of New York _including its statutes of limitations_ without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York County, New York for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that New York County, New York is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
    1. **Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SNAPCAST. For any dispute with SnapCast, you agree to first contact us at [hello@getsnapcast.com](mailto:hello@getsnapcast.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that SnapCast has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, &quot;Claims&quot;), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York, unless you and SnapCast agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney&#39;s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing SnapCast from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.
    1. **Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&#39; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SNAPCAST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the &#39;last modified&#39; date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.
    1. **Entire Agreement/Severability**. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with SnapCast in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and SnapCast concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.
    1. **No Waiver**. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and SnapCast&#39;s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
